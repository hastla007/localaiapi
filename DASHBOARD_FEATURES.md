## 🔌 API Endpoints Added

The dashboard adds these new endpoints to your API:

### Dashboard Routes
- `GET /dashboard` - Main dashboard page
- `GET /api/dashboard/status` - System status JSON
- `GET /api/dashboard/results` - List of generated files
- `GET /api/dashboard/metrics` - Performance metrics
- `GET /api/dashboard/logs` - API logs
- `POST /api/dashboard/logs/clear` - Clear logs
- `GET /api/dashboard/settings` - Get settings
- `POST /api/dashboard/settings` - Save settings

All existing API endpoints remain unchanged!

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Keep Dashboard Open**: Monitor your API while running n8n workflows
2. **Watch VRAM**: Unload models when switching between different types of work
3. **Check Logs**: First place to look when debugging issues
4. **Track Metrics**: Optimize your generation parameters based on timing data
5. **Test Quickly**: Use the "Test Generation" button to verify API is working

---

## 🔒 Security Note

The dashboard has no authentication - it's designed for local use only. **Do not expose port 8000 to the internet!**

---

## 📊 Performance Impact

**Minimal Overhead:**
- Dashboard uses <1MB memory
- Metrics tracking: ~5MB for 100 requests
- No impact on generation speed
- Logs limited to 200 entries
